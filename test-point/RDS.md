- [ ] backup 
  - [ ] preferred backup window
  - [ ] backup retention period
  - [ ] I/O suspension for single
  - [ ] Point-In-Time Recovery
- [ ] snapshot 
  - [ ] DB Snapshots make entire DB instance
  - [ ] from one region to another region,a copy retain in that region
  - [ ] Because KMS encryption keys are specific to the region that they are created in, encrypted snapshot cannot be copied to another region
  - [ ] DB Snapshot Sharing 
    - [ ] DB snapshot that uses an option group with permanent or persistent options cannot be shared
    - [ ] KMS key policy must first be updated by adding any accounts to share the snapshot with, before sharing an encrypted DB snapshot
- [ ] replication 
  - [ ] routing read queries from applications to the Read Replica
  - [ ] Failover mechanism automatically changes the DNS record of the DB instance to point to the standby DB instance
  - [ ] Multi-AZ deployment 
    - [ ] read-only traffic, use a Read Replica.
    - [ ] synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone
    - [ ] must be in same region
    - [ ] Read Replica 
      - [ ] RDS sets up a secure communications channel between the source DB instance and the Read Replica, if that Read Replica is in a different AWS region from the DB instance
      - [ ] replication link is broken, A Read Replica can be promoted to a new independent source DB
      - [ ] use some tools like HAPROXY, with two url ,one for write one tor read
- [ ] security 
  - [ ] Encryption enabled at creating, can not change key later
  - [ ] Once encryption, log,snapshot,autobackup, replica are encripted
  - [ ] Cross region replicas and snapshots copy does not work since the key is only available in a single region
  - [ ] Database security groups default to a “deny all” access mode
- [ ] monitor 
  - [ ] 监控的metric 16 项, ReplicaLag
  - [ ] Backup not notify for snapshot
- [ ] maintenance 
  - [ ] Multi-AZ deployment, preform standby, promote standby, preform old primary
  - [ ] RDS takes two DB snapshots , before upgrade, after upgrade
